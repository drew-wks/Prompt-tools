This was a proof of concept that I launched publicly on July 3 2023 to build a more robust chat input using Open AI's Chat GPT chatcompletion API. The POC works by allowing the user to supply additional information, allowing them greater control over the manner in which the ChatGPT model performs task. With it, you can do things like provide brand guidelines, an ethics statements, or some other company policy that you wish to guide the model in its response.  Behind the scenes, the form generates a user and a system message, which is passes to ChatGPT via the openai.ChatCompletion API.

The capability shown in this POC has since been incorporated by OpenAI into its ChatGPT Chat product as the Custom Instructions feature, but you can still access it here in its original conception.
